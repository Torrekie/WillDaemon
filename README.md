# WillDaemon
WillDaemon is a tool to make your git repos or something else from private to public in plan. Make a will when you feels unable to keep yourselves alive.

## Why this?
Cuz I felt like I'm now in a very terrible condition, whether my emotional or my physical health.

I hope there's only I am needed to use this, you all should keep yourselves happy and healthy.

If you can't, at least, make sure once you have gone, your messages could be sent to the most important people for you. This could probably be the only thing you have left on the Earth.

## Why 'Git repo' mentioned in description but not something else?
Because of my work and character, I hardly communicate with people I know in reality. This caused me to be severely socially lacking and suffered from depression.

In many cases, family members and friends may not be as important as those you know on the Internet. This is because of the Internet has brought about a huge flow of information to us, the uninterrupted communication makes us feel that the Internet is more real than the real world.

In my case, I have met many friends on the Internet with talents, most of them knows how to use Git and how to write codes.

I would like to put my wills in one of my private repos so that I would be able to update the content any time. Once it get public, people could know how my mind changes and what I have suffered from git history.

## Can it send emails or do something else rather than public git repos?
Sure. Just put them into your shell script and make this script scheduled to launch.
